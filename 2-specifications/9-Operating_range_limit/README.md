# 2.9. Operating range limit

When installing the robot, consider the fact that you can adjust the operating range freely within the full operating area. 

The operating range limit is effective in the following environment.

*	When you want to limit the operating area while the robot is operating
*	When the robot can collide with the surrounding devices
*	When the length of applied cable or hose is limited

There are 2 methods to limit the operating area of the robot.

*	Software limit (Applied to the entire axis)
*	Mechanical stopper (1 axis)

Mechanical stopper is a physical device. The robot cannot exceed the mechanical stopper. The mechanical stoppers of 1axes are fixed. For 2~6 axes, only the software limit can be applied.

When the mechanical stopper collides with the robot, it is deformed and the strength cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, you must replace the mechanical stopper in this case.
