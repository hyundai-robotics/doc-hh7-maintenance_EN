Be sure to check if any operators are inside of the safety fence when starting the automatic operation. Operating without checking the presence of operators may cause a personal injury.

    <li>
Before starting the automatic operation, check and confirm that the program number, step number, mode, and starting selection are in the possible state for automatic operation. If starting with the other programs or steps selected, the robot could move in an unpredicted way, and lead to an accident. 
</li><br>
    <li>
Before starting the automatic operation, check if the robot is properly located to get started. Check whether the program number or step number is identical with the location of robot. Even if it's all identical, accidents are still possible to occur due to an abnormal movement when the robot is differently located.

    <li>
Be prepared to immediately press the emergency stop button when starting the automatic operation. Immediately press the emergency stop button in case of robot's unexpected movements or emergency.

Be sure to detect any abnormalities by checking the route, condition, or sound of robot movement. Sometimes the robot may be abnormally operated including a sudden break down. However, it will show a certain indication before the break down. Understand the robot's normal condition well in order to catch the symptom in advance.
