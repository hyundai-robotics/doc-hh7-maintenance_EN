# 6.3.5. Encoder

Position offset, malfunction, and out of control movement as well as staggering at stop, irregular twitching may occur when the Encoder is in bad condition. This case has nothing to do with such phenomena as mechanical abnormal sound, overheating, and vibration.

*	Diagnostics

    ①	Check for any encoder data failure.<br>
    ②	Use reference pins and blocks to check the positional data is correct at pin position.<br> 
    ③	Check for any irregular variations in the encoder data when moving each robot axis.v 
    ④	Replace the servo amp board(BD542) to check errors. 
 
*	Resolution

    ①	If cabling turns out to be in good condition without any damage, replace the encoder.<br>
    ②	If there is no error after replacing the servo amp board(BD542), replace the servo amp board.
