The robot is very heavy and strong, even at low speeds. When entering the safety fence, one must observe the relevant safety regulations of its pertinent country.

The operators always must be aware of the unexpected movements of robot. Robots are able to move fast shortly after being stopped. The operators should know that the robot is able to move in a different route, without any notice, by means of external signals. Thus, when trying to stop the robot during teaching or operating test, one should be able to stop the robot with a teach pendant or control panel.

When entering the working envelope through the safety gate, you must take the teach pendant with yourself so that other people can not operate the robot. Make sure to post up the control panel a sign indicating the state of robot handling.
