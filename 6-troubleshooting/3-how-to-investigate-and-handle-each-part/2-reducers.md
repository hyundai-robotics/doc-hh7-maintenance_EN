When turning [ON][OFF] the brake release switch of axis H and axis V, be sure to take necessary precautions to prevent the ARM from dropping, and then switch the brake release [ON][OFF].

*	Diagnostics

①	Check if there is vibration and abnormal sound during operation and also whether there is abnormal heating with the reducer during operation.<br>
②	To see whether there is diversion and wear with the reducer, check if any abnormality can be felt, by holding the first arm and rotate the robot while the S axis brake release switch in [On] state.<br>
③	Check if peripheral equipment has been contacted with the robot before the abnormality<br>
(In some cases, the reducer may be damaged due to the shock from contact)

*	Resolution

Replace the reducer. A chain block is needed to lift and hang the robot ARM. Contact our service office for any difficulties

When turning [ON][OFF] the brake release switch, be sure to take necessary precautions to prevent the ARM from dropping, and then switch the brake release [ON][OFF].

*	Diagnostics

①	Check out any vibration, abnormal sound, or overheating of the reducer when the robot is in operation.<br> 
②	Check out any play in the reducer by shaking the End Effector (such as spot gun and hand devices, etc.) back and forth.<br> 
③	Turn motor off, with the brake release switch [ON], and check that the axis can be rotated by hand. If not, the reducer is in bad condition.<br> 
④	Check if peripheral equipment has been contacted with the robot before the abnormality.<br>
(Damage may occur to the reducer due to the contacting impact)

*	Resolution

①	Replace the reducer.<br>
②	Replace the entire wrist section.<br>
(The replacement of entire wrist should be a quick and reliable resolution as it takes time and necessary equipment for reducer replacement)
