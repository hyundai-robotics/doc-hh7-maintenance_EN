# 1.10.5. Restricting the working Envelope

When the robot is not necessary to reach certain area for specific applications, working envelope of the robot can be limited to secure the sufficient safety working area. This will reduce the damage or loss in case of robot's collision with external safety devices such as safety fence, etc. The movement of axes 1, 2, and 3 of HR, HX, HS and HA can be limited by means of mechanical stopper or electrical limit switches. In this case, the corresponding software limitation parameters must be also changed. If necessary, movement of wrist 3 axes can be restricted, too. Limitation of working envelope for all the axes could be carried out by the user. The robot is delivered to customer as the status of full working envelope setting.
