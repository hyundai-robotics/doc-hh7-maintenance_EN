In case of operating test, errors in design or teaching and inferiority in manufacturing are possibly seen in the entire system such as teaching program, jig, and sequence. Thus, be more careful and safe in case of operating test. Accidents may occur by these combined causes.

            Before handling, check the stop buttons and signal functions to stop the robot such as emergency stop button or stop button. And then, check the abnormality - detective movements. Above all, it is the most critical to check all the stop signals. It would be the most important to stop the robot when any possible accidents are predicted. 
        </li><br>		
		<li>
            In case of operating test, start the robot at low speed(approximately 20%~30%) in the variable speed function, and repeat it more than one cycle to check the movements. If any errors are found, immediately correct them. After then, increase in speed (50% → 75% → 100%) gradually, and repeat more than one cycle respectively to check the movements. Operating at high speed from the very beginning may cause a serious accident.

           In case of operating test, it is hard to predict what problems would happen. Do not enter the safety fence during operating test. Unexpected accidents are likely to occur because of its low reliability.
