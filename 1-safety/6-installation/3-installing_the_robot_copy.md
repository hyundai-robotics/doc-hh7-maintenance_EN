Install the robot as per the planning and layout which has been previously reviewed and studied for its optimized performance and functionality. In case of poor conditions for robot installation, the serious problems can take place, including error of relative position between robot and workpiece during operation, bad performance quality of robot caused by vibration, shortening lifetime, and cause of serious accidents. Thus, pay attention to the following precautions when installing the robot.

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
<li>
Design and install the robot system properly in compliance with laws, regulations, and safety requirements enable in the country where the robot system is installed. 
</li><br>
    <li>
All the workers for the robot system must have the complete knowledge on the information specified in the application and supplementary manual, and proficiently operate and handle the industrial robot. 
</li><br>
    <li>
Installation workers of robot must follow the safety instructions and apply them to the installation when they face any safety problems.
</li><br>
    <li>
System provider must ensure that all the circuits utilizing safety functions perfectly perform in a safe way.
</li><br>
    <li>
Install main power supply to be disconnected from outside of the robot’s working envelope. 
</li><br>
    <li>
System provider must ensure that all the circuits utilizing emergency stop function perfectly perform in a safe way.
</li><br>
    <li>
or the immediate emergency stop, install emergency stop button within the accessible distance for the operator.
</li><br>      
</ol>

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
<li>
Eliminate any interference with peripheral equipment considering the dimension and working envelope. 
</li><br>
    <li>
Avoid such place for installing which is directly exposed to the sun, extremely humid, contaminated by oil or chemicals, and containing a large amount of metal powder and explosive gas.
</li><br>
    <li>
Install at the ambient temperature ranged 0~45℃. 
</li><br>
    <li>
Secure sufficient space for the easier disassembly and maintenance.
</li><br>
    <li>
Install safety fence with a gate, and prohibit any person from entering the robot's working envelope.
</li><br>
    <li>
Remove any obstacles out of the robot’s working envelope.
</li><br>
    <li>
Take a special measure, considering thermodynamics of controller, if the robot is installed near the heating elements or places exposed directly to the sun.
</li><br>
    <li>
Take a special measure if the robot is installed in a place of abundant dust such as metal powder in the air.
</li><br>
    <li>
Install the robot not to transmit welding electric current. In other word, insulate SPOT GUN with/from the robot’s wrist.
</li><br>
    <li>
Grounding is very critical in preventing electric shock and malfunction caused by noise, and thus install as following instructions. 
            <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman" start="1">
                <li>
tall an exclusive grounding terminal using class 3 or higher. (For the input voltage of 400V of higher, use special class 3 or higher.) 
</li>
<li>
Connect grounding line into the grounding bus-bar inside of the control panel. 
</li>
<li>
In case of direct grounding on the floor by anchoring, two-point grounding both by robot manipulator and by controller can produce a “ground loop” and contrariwise cause abnormal operation. In this case, connect the grounding line to the base of robot manipulator and disconnect the second grounding point to the controller. If the robot vibrates even after stopping, double-check the grounding status because the possible main causes could be an incomplete grounding or “ground loop”.
</li>
<li>
In the use of internal transgun(GUN), there is a possible danger of dropping because the primary power cable is directly connected to the spot gun. In this case, directly connect the grounding line to the base of robot manipulator in order to prevent any electric shock and protect the control panel, but do not connect it to the controller.
