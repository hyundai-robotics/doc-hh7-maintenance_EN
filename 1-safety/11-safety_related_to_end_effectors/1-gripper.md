<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
		<li>
      When a gripper is used to grip a workpiece, there should be safety precautions for unexpected dropping of the loaded workpiece. 
    </li>	<br>
		<li>
      When any end effectors or devices are installed on the robot arm, use the required size and piece of bolt, and securely fasten as per the required torque using torque wrench. Do not use the bolt which has rust or dirt on its surface. 
    </li><br>
    <li>
      End effector must be designed and manufactured not to exceed the maximum allowable load at the wrist of robot. Even though power or air supply stops, the gripped workpiece must not be dropped from the gripper. In order to remove any risks and problems which may cause personal injury and/or physical damage, the sharp edge and projecting part of end effector must be made dull and smooth.
