# 6.3.3. Brake

In case of brakes failure, each axis possibly drops with the motors [OFF]. Or, in reverse, brakes possibly operate even with the motors [ON]. The latter causes overload and noise.

When intending to operate the entire robot without the motors [ON], operate it with the brake release switch [ON]. Before turning the switch [ON], take necessary precautions to prevent the ARM from dropping as the robot ARM will drop by gravity.




*	Diagnostics

    Check if the brake can be heard in operation, by turning the brake release switch [ON] [OFF] alternately with the motors [OFF]. If not heard, the brake cable may be broken. (When operating the brake release switch [ON] [OFF], be careful of ARM dropping. The brake release switch is located on the panel in the controller cabinet door.)

*	Resolution
    If cables turn out to be good condition, replace the motor.
