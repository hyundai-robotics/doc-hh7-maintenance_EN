# 6.3.1. Fulcrum bearing at each point

If the fulcrum bearing itself at each point is damaged, vibration, abnormal sound and overload could be caused. In addition, if the bearing fixing nuts are loosened, diversion will occur to the bearing. If diversion occurs in that way, the bearing could be damaged.



*	Diagnostics

    ①	Check if there is diversion with the bearing by applying force to the first and second arms.<br>
    (If the chain block is used, keep the postures of the first and second arms, and then check if there is diversion with the bearing while no load is applied to the reducer)

    ②	Before abnormality occurs, check if the robot contacts any peripheral device.

*	Solutions

    Replace the bearing. In this process, equipment such as a chain block is needed to hang the robot arm. Contact our service office if you have any difficulties.
