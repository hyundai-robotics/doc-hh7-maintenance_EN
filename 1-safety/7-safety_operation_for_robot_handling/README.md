# 1.7. Safety Operation for Robot Handling


Follow the safety instructions to prevent any accidents. Don't modify nor ignore safety devices or circuits at any time, and be careful of electric shock.

All the normal operations in an automatic mode must be performed outside of the safety fence. Check the robot's working envelope if anyone is inside before operating.
